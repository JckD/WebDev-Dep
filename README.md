Steps to deploy the web application:
1.	Download the Git repository.
2.	Import “dt211.sql” into php my admin.
3.	Place the bookshop folder into the xampp/htdocs folder on your local machine.
4.	Start the “Apache” and “MySQL” service in the XAMPP Control Panel.
5.  If you are downloading this from GIT hub you must create a folder called uploads as GIT hub does not support this.
6.	Type http://localhost/WebDev-Dep-master/index.php into your browser search bar.
7.	Traverse the web application from the “index.php” home page.
